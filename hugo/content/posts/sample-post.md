Welcome to your first Hugo post! This sample demonstrates the features available in your new Hugo site.

## Introduction

Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator written in Go. Combined with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI, you can create beautiful websites quickly.

## Features

### Speed

Hugo builds sites incredibly fast - often in under a second. This makes for an excellent development experience.

### Flexibility

With Hugo's templating system, you can create any kind of website:

- Blogs
- Documentation sites
- Portfolio sites
- Landing pages
- And more!

### Modern Styling

This site uses:

1. **TailwindCSS 4** - A utility-first CSS framework
2. **DaisyUI 5** - Beautiful component library
3. **Typography plugin** - For beautiful prose styling

## Code Example

Here's a simple code block:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('Hugo'));
```

## Conclusion

Start building your site by editing the templates in the `layouts/` directory and adding content in `content/`.

Happy coding!
