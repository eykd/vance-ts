# Prompting Best Practices for Nano Banana

## Foundational Principles

### Descriptive Sentences Over Keywords

The model interprets semantic meaning, not keyword matching. Provide context, nuance, and relational information.

**Transform keywords into sentences:**

- `elf, armor, fantasy, silver` → `An ornate set of elven plate armor engraved with delicate silver leaf patterns, with a high collar and falcon-wing-shaped shoulder guards.`
- `logo, Merry Christmas, elegant font` → `Design a logo with the text 'Merry Christmas!' in an elegant serif font. Keep the overall design clean and modern.`

### Positive Framing

Describe what you want, not what to exclude. Negative constraints are unreliable.

- ❌ `a street with no cars`
- ✅ `a quiet empty street`

### Formula for Text-to-Image

`<Create/generate an image of> <subject> <action> <scene>`

Example progression:

1. `Create an image of a cat napping`
2. `Create an image of a cat napping in a sunbeam on a windowsill`

## Professional Photography Lexicon

Use technical terms for precise control:

### Lighting

| Term               | Effect                                         | Example                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Golden Hour        | Soft, warm, diffused light                     | `...illuminated by soft golden hour light streaming through a window`       |
| Cinematic Lighting | High-contrast, moody, dramatic                 | `...with dramatic cinematic lighting from a desk lamp casting long shadows` |
| Rembrandt Lighting | Classic portrait lighting with shadow triangle | `...with Rembrandt lighting creating depth`                                 |

### Lens & Aperture

| Term       | Effect                                | Example                                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Bokeh      | Soft blur in out-of-focus areas       | `...with a soft, creamy bokeh background` |

| Wide angle | Expansive, dramatic perspective       | `...shot with a wide-angle lens`          |

### Composition

| Term           | Effect                       | Example                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Rule of Thirds | Balanced, engaging placement | `...composed using the rule of thirds`         |
| Leading Lines  | Draw eye to subject          | `...with leading lines guiding to the subject` |

### Film Stocks

- `...with the nostalgic aesthetic of being shot on Kodak Portra 400 film`
- `...like Fujifilm Velvia with saturated colors`

## Artistic Style References

### By Artist

- `...in the expressive, post-impressionist style of Vincent van Gogh`

## Advanced Techniques

### Markdown-Structured Complex Prompts

For multi-requirement images, use dashed lists:

```
Create an image featuring three kittens.

All kittens MUST follow these descriptions EXACTLY:
- Left: black-and-silver fur, wearing blue denim overalls and baseball hat
- Middle: white-and-gold fur with gold goatee, wearing golden monocle
- Right: pink-and-green fur, wearing sports jersey

Composition requirements:
- All kittens positioned using rule of thirds
- All kittens laying prone, facing camera
- Shot in multimillion-dollar Victorian mansion
- Neutral diffuse 3PM lighting
- NEVER include any text or watermarks
```

### Multi-Image Fusion Techniques

**Subject Insertion:**

```
Place the person from the first image into the forest scene, carefully matching the natural lighting and shadows of the environment.
```

**Style Transfer:**

```
Reimagine the first photo in the expressive, swirling style of the second image.
```

**Design Mixing:**

```
Apply the shimmering, colorful pattern of the butterfly wings to the fabric of the dress.
```

### ControlNet-Style Guided Generation

Provide a sketch/wireframe as input, then map elements:

```
Generate characters sitting at a poker table. Map the following to the color-coded poses in the image:
- Green position: Spongebob SquarePants
- Red position: Shadow the Hedgehog
- Blue position: Taylor Swift
```

## Quality Boosters

Terms that demonstrably improve output quality:

- `award-winning`
- `Pulitzer Prize winning`
- `professional`
- `highly-detailed`
- `DSLR camera`
- `4K resolution`
- `masterpiece`

---

## Multi-Turn Editing Strategy

### Incremental Building

Focus on one significant change per turn:

1. `Add a floor-to-ceiling bookshelf on the back wall.`
2. `Add this exact sofa, placing it naturally.`
3. `Change walls to sage green, preserving new furniture.`

### Anchor Prompts for Consistency

Combat drift by reinforcing critical elements:

```
Add sunglasses to her face, making sure to keep her facial structure and expression identical to the previous image.
```

### When to Stop

- Limit to 2-3 sequential edits before quality degrades
- Treat upscaling as final step (use external tool)

## Troubleshooting Patterns

### Prompt Ignored

1. Simplify to single unambiguous instruction
2. Ensure subject is central, background uncluttered
3. Start new conversation, rephrase with different vocabulary
4. Minor crop/rotation of source can "unstick" the model

### Aspect Ratio Problems

**Frame Hack:** Create blank image in desired ratio (e.g., 1920x1080 white rectangle), upload alongside source, instruct model to work within frame.

### Consistency Loss Over Edits

- Keep source images high-quality with good lighting
- Use anchor phrases reinforcing key features
- Consider regenerating from scratch with consolidated prompt

### Text Rendering Issues

- Be specific: font style, color, size, placement
- For complex text: render externally, provide as input, ask to composite
- Keep text short and simple
