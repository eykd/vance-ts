## Mixing Styles

You can blend elements from different styles for different content sections:

**Homepage hero:** Alex Cattoni energy to grab attention
**About page:** Ann Handley warmth to build connection
**Product pages:** Joanna Wiebe voice-driven persuasion
**Blog posts:** Seth Godin philosophical insights
**Sales pages:** Gary Halbert urgent directness

**Key principle:** Stay consistent within each piece of content. Don't switch styles mid-paragraph.

## Integration with Readability Analysis

Use `analyze.js` to verify your content matches the readability target for your chosen style:

```bash
node scripts/analyze.js content/posts/my-post.md
```

**If readability doesn't match:**

- **Too difficult (grade too high):** Shorten sentences, simplify vocabulary, break up paragraphs
- **Too easy (grade too low):** May be fine! Most web content should be accessible. Only adjust if you need more sophisticated tone.

## Providing Advisory Guidance

When helping users match a copywriter style:

1. **Read the current content**
2. **Identify specific deviations** (sentence length, word choice, tone)
3. **Provide before/after examples** from their actual content
4. **Explain why** the change improves the match
5. **Respect their judgment** on which changes to implement

**Never:**

- Silently rewrite their content
- Criticize their writing skill
- Apply rigid rules without context
- Ignore their brand voice constraints
