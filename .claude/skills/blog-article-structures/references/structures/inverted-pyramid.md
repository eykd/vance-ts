# Inverted Pyramid

**Core principle**: Most important information first, descending order of importance.

## When to Use

- News, announcements, press releases
- SEO content (keywords early)
- Mobile-first content
- Content that can be cut from bottom without losing critical value

## When NOT to Use

- Features requiring narrative buildup
- Persuasive sales content (gives away the ending)
- Content where emotional journey matters

## Template

```
LEAD (Most critical—5Ws + H in first paragraph):
Who, what, when, where, why, how—all essential facts

SUPPORTING DETAILS (Second priority):
- Key methodology/data points
- Expert quotes providing interpretation
- Immediate implications/responses

BACKGROUND (Lower priority):
- Historical context
- Related prior information
- Industry trends

TAIL (Least critical—can be cut):
- Links to sources
- Related resources
- Contact information
```

## Key Insight

Developed for telegraph-era reliability; persists because it matches F-pattern scanning behavior. Nielsen Norman research confirms users focus heavily on opening content.
