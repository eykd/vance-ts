# Pillar / Cornerstone Content Structure

**Core principle**: Comprehensive resource covering broad topic exhaustively, serving as hub linking to detailed "cluster content" on subtopics.

## Why It Works

HubSpot achieved 25% YoY traffic increase and improved rankings for 2M+ keywords with topic clusters. Signals topic authority to search engines, creates clear internal linking architecture, prevents content cannibalization.

## When to Use

- Building authority on core business topics (3-5 pillars recommended)
- Launching content strategy for competitive topics
- Creating evergreen resources
- SEO-focused content programs

## When NOT to Use

- Topics too narrow to support 10+ cluster articles
- Time-sensitive/trending topics
- Lacking resources for significant investment
