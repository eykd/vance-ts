# Problem-Agitate-Solution (PAS)

**Core principle**: Identify pain → intensify emotional impact → present solution as remedy.

## Why It Works

Loss aversion: humans are 2-3x more motivated to avoid pain than gain pleasure (Kahneman/Tversky). 95% of purchasing decisions are driven by emotion (Zaltman).

## When to Use

- Landing pages, email marketing, cold outreach
- Service pages, lead magnets
- Conversion-focused content
- Readers actively experiencing the problem

## When NOT to Use

- Health/wellness (negative framing backfires)
- Aspirational luxury products
- Brand awareness without conversion goals
- Audiences not experiencing the problem

## Template

```
PROBLEM (1-2 paragraphs):
Identify the reader's specific pain point. Use "you" language.
"How many hours did you lose this week chasing project updates?"

AGITATE (2-3 paragraphs):
Intensify consequences. Be specific about what happens if unchecked:
- Team/relationship impacts
- Financial costs
- Time/opportunity costs
- Escalation scenario

SOLUTION (3-4 paragraphs):
- Features mapped directly to pains described above
- Proof (testimonial, case study, data)
- Simple implementation path
- Clear CTA with incentive
```

## PASO Variation

Add **Outcome** after Solution: Paint life after implementation.
"Imagine ending Friday knowing every project is on track."
