# Beginner-Intermediate-Advanced (Tiered) Structure

**Core principle**: Organize by skill level, letting readers self-select appropriate depth.

## Why It Works

Aligned with Bloom's Taxonomy: beginners need recall/understanding, intermediates need application/analysis, advanced need evaluation/creation. Reduces frustration (too hard) or boredom (too easy). Increases content lifetime value as readers return when they progress.

## When to Use

- Technical skill training
- Comprehensive topic coverage for diverse audiences
- Course series with progression
- Documentation for products with variable user expertise

## When NOT to Use

- Single-piece content (not series)
- Topics without clear progression
- Homogeneous expert audiences
- Quick-answer content

**Note**: Requires 3x+ content investment.
