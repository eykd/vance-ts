# Listicle (Numbered List) Structure

**Core principle**: Organize around numbered sequence of items, tips, examples, or recommendations.

## Why It Works

Minds break information into categories naturally (Journal of Consumer Research). Numbered lists trigger completion desire, create curiosity gaps in titles, accommodate skimming (73% of readers skim). Odd numbers (7, 9, 11) perceived as more credible.

## When to Use

- Resource compilations
- Tips and advice
- Tool recommendations
- Beginner guides
- "Best of" lists

## When NOT to Use

- Nuanced arguments requiring linear narrative
- Topics needing deep analysis
- When quality differentiation matters (listicles are common)
