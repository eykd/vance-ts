# FAQ / Q&A Structure

**Core principle**: Organize content around discrete reader questions for targeted, non-linear consumption.

## Why It Works

Matches how users naturally seek information—specific questions, direct answers. Reduces cognitive load through targeting. Creates scannability. FAQ schema enables featured snippets and "People Also Ask" visibility.

## When to Use

- Product/service pages addressing concerns
- Pre-purchase decision support
- Knowledge bases
- Controversial/misunderstood topics
- Reducing support tickets

## When NOT to Use

- Content requiring narrative flow
- Complex topics needing progressive understanding
- Deep-dive analysis
- When questions feel forced
