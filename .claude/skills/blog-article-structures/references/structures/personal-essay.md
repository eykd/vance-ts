# Personal Essay Structure

**Core principle**: First-person narrative exploring specific experience to illuminate broader truth—connection through vulnerability and specificity.

## Why It Works

Creates intimacy through first-person POV and specific sensory details (memory ties to senses). The dual journey—outer events and inner transformation—engages emotionally while narrow scope maintains focus. Universal themes make personal experience resonate broadly.

## When to Use

- Personal blogs
- Lifestyle content
- Thought leadership
- Building trust and relatability
- Processing and sharing significant experiences

## When NOT to Use

- Purely informational content
- News
- Reference material

## Structural Options

### The "e" Structure

Start at moment of decision, move forward briefly, then loop back for context before continuing forward.

### Circular Structure

Open with key challenge in action, explore through non-chronological anecdotes, resolve with new understanding.

### Two Timelines

Alternate past and present until they merge at the insight.

## Template (e-structure)

```
1. COLD OPEN: Start in medias res
   "I stood in the doorway of my childhood home for the last time..."
   Drop reader into a charged moment

2. BRIEF FORWARD: What happens next
   Create tension—reader knows something is coming
   Don't resolve yet

3. FLASHBACK: Context—how you arrived here
   "It started three months earlier when..."
   Provide necessary background
   Sensory details that ground the experience

4. BUILD: Layer experiences with reflection
   External events interwoven with internal processing
   Show change happening gradually
   Include doubt, setback, complexity

5. RETURN TO PRESENT: Complete the arc
   Come back to the opening moment
   New understanding revealed through how you see it now

6. INSIGHT: Universal takeaway
   What does your specific experience illuminate for the reader?
   Don't preach—let it emerge naturally
```
