# What-Why-How Framework

**Core principle**: Concept definition → rationale → implementation.

## Why It Works

Activates prior knowledge before adding new information. Creates motivation through purpose before demanding effort. Follows natural inquiry pattern. "After reading the Why, readers should feel compelled to blaze through the rest."

## When to Use

- Introducing new concepts, tools, methodologies
- Explaining complex strategies
- Educational content requiring buy-in
- Change management communications
- Thought leadership

## When NOT to Use

- Emergency how-to content (skip to How)
- Audiences who already understand What and Why
- Simple topics not requiring justification
- Quick reference content

## Template
