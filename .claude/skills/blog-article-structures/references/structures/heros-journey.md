# Hero's Journey (StoryBrand Adaptation)

**Core principle**: Customer is the hero; brand is the mentor/guide. Map transformation through challenge.

## Why It Works

Joseph Campbell's monomyth appears across cultures because it maps universal human transformation through challenge. In content marketing (Donald Miller's StoryBrand), positioning customer as hero creates emotional resonance while keeping focus on reader outcomes.

## When to Use

- Brand storytelling
- Customer testimonials
- Product origin stories
- Transformation-focused content (fitness, career, business growth)

## When NOT to Use

- News
- Quick tips
- Reference content
- Any format where journey matters less than information

## Template

```
1. ORDINARY WORLD: Establish the hero's starting point
   "Sarah was struggling with [problem]..."
   Paint the relatable frustration or limitation

2. CALL TO ADVENTURE: The inciting incident
   "One day, she realized she needed change..."
   What triggered the decision to seek a solution?

3. MEET THE MENTOR: Your brand/solution enters
   "She discovered [your solution/brand]..."
   Present yourself as guide, not hero
   Offer tools, wisdom, path forward

4. FACING CHALLENGES: The tests
   "It wasn't easy—here's what she encountered..."
   Real obstacles overcome
   How the guide helped navigate

5. THE TRANSFORMATION: Success achieved
   "With persistence and [your tools], she..."
   Specific, measurable results
   The moment of triumph

6. THE RETURN: New normal + wisdom shared
   "Now Sarah [achieved result]—here's what she learned..."
   How life is different
   Wisdom to share with others on similar journey
```

## Key Principles

- **Customer = Hero**: They're on the journey, facing challenges

- **Transformation = Promise**: Show the change your solution enables
- **Specificity**: Real names, real numbers, real challenges
