# Narrative Arc Structure

**Core principle**: Classic five-part story structure adapted for non-fiction: exposition → rising action → climax → falling action → resolution.

## Why It Works

Princeton research: listeners' brain activity mirrors and anticipates storytellers' patterns (neural coupling). Emotionally engaging narratives cause cortisol and oxytocin increases, driving empathy and action (Zak). The hippocampus imposes order through cause-and-effect narratives—our brains crave this structure.

## When to Use

- Case studies
- Transformation stories
- Brand origin stories
- Content requiring emotional engagement
- Long-form educational content with a journey

## When NOT to Use

- Quick reference content
- Technical documentation
- News-style posts
- Readers needing information immediately

## Template

```
1. EXPOSITION: Establish the situation
   Introduce the "ordinary world"—the problem, context, stakes
   Make the reader understand what's at risk

2. RISING ACTION: The journey of exploration
   - Initial attempts and early obstacles
   - Escalating challenges
   - Setbacks that raise stakes
   - Building tension toward the turning point

3. CLIMAX: The breakthrough moment
   The key insight, decision, or turning point
   Maximum tension followed by resolution

4. FALLING ACTION: Implementation
   How the solution was applied
   Immediate consequences of the breakthrough

5. RESOLUTION: Results and lessons
   Transformation achieved
   What changed, what was learned
   Reader takeaway / universal application
```

## Key Elements

- **Stakes**: Reader must understand what's at risk
- **Tension**: Problems must escalate before resolution
- **Transformation**: Something must change
- **Universality**: Connect specific story to broader truth

## Best For

Business case studies, personal development, memoir-style content, educational how-tos with personal examples.

## Length

Typically 1,500-3,000 words.
