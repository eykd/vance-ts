# AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

**Core principle**: Map the customer journey: capture attention → build interest → create desire → drive action.

## Why It Works

Hierarchy of effects: consumers move through cognitive (thinking), affective (feeling), and behavioral (doing) stages. Each stage builds on the previous—can't create desire without interest.

## When to Use

- Full marketing funnels
- Long-form landing pages
- Blog posts with conversion goals
- Email sequences (spread across emails)
- Product launches, video ads

## When NOT to Use

- Audiences deep in decision-making (skip to Desire/Action)
- Impulse purchases
- Purely informational content
- Technical documentation

## Template

```
ATTENTION (Hook—opening paragraph):
Pattern interrupt, surprising stat, provocative question.
"What if you could add $50,000 to your annual income by learning
one skill?"

INTEREST (2-3 paragraphs):
Engage by demystifying/reducing perceived barrier.
- What's actually required
- Achievable timeline
- Accessible skills involved

DESIRE (3-4 paragraphs):
Create emotional want through proof and benefits.
- Social proof: "847 careers launched..."
- Transformation testimonials with specifics
- What's included (tangible value)
- Scarcity/exclusivity elements

ACTION (Final section):
Clear, specific next step with urgency.
- Deadline or limited availability
- Primary CTA
- Secondary CTA for uncertain readers (lower commitment)
```

## Combining with Other Structures

- Use PAS within the Attention stage
- Use BAB's After section as Desire content
- Layer AIDA as macro structure with PAS/BAB in individual sections
