# Before-After-Bridge (BAB)

**Core principle**: Current reality → ideal future state → your solution as the connecting path.

## Why It Works

Makes reader the protagonist of their transformation story. Activates visualization of success. Addresses both motivations: chasing pleasure AND avoiding pain.

## When to Use

- Cold emails (low-awareness prospects)
- Transformation marketing
- Coaching/consulting landing pages
- Products with clear positive outcomes
- Visual before/after demonstrations

## When NOT to Use

- Prevention products (insurance, security) with no aspirational "after"
- Emergency services
- Low-consideration purchases
- Deep decision-makers needing specifics

## Template

```
BEFORE (1-2 sentences):
Paint current pain state with specificity.
"Right now, your team is probably spending 15+ hours weekly on
manual tasks—time that could go to strategic work."

AFTER (2-3 sentences):
Vivid ideal future. Use sensory/emotional language.
"Imagine campaigns running on autopilot while you sleep. New leads
automatically nurtured. Your team finally has bandwidth for
big-picture work."

BRIDGE (2-3 sentences):
Your solution + proof + simple path.
"[Product] has helped 200+ teams reclaim 12 hours per week.
Setup takes minutes—no developer required.
97% of users report positive ROI within 60 days."
