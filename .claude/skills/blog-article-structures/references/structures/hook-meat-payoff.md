# Hook-Meat-Payoff Structure

**Core principle**: Capture attention → deliver value with mini-payoffs → conclude with actionable takeaway.

## Why It Works

Buffer research: a good hook doesn't guarantee success, but a bad one almost guarantees failure. Curiosity gaps create psychological tension; mini-payoffs trigger dopamine throughout. Optimized for engagement over depth.

## When to Use

- Social media posts
- YouTube videos
- Viral content
- Listicles
- Quick-read articles
- Entertainment/lifestyle blogs

## When NOT to Use

- Academic content
- In-depth technical guides
- Nuanced topics requiring careful buildup

## Template

```
HOOK (First 1-3 sentences):
Pattern interrupt, curiosity gap, or surprising claim
"I made $50,000 from one blog post. Here's the formula..."

Techniques:
- Surprising statistic
- Provocative question
- Bold claim
- Story opening in medias res
- Contrast/contradiction

MEAT (Bulk of content):
Deliver on the hook's promise with substance

Structure with mini-payoffs throughout:
- The exact strategy (step-by-step)
- What most people get wrong
- The tools I used
- Real numbers and screenshots
- Unexpected twist or insight

Each section should reward continued reading

PAYOFF (Conclusion):
Deliver the promised value explicitly
Specific, actionable takeaway readers can implement immediately
CTA that extends the relationship
```
