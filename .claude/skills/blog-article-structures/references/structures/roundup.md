# Roundup / Curated Content Structure

**Core principle**: Aggregate expert perspectives, resources, or data from multiple sources with editorial synthesis.

## Why It Works

Orbit Media ranks roundup posts as most effective format despite being least commonly used. Featured experts typically share content featuring them (promotion + backlinks). Multiple authoritative voices boost E-E-A-T. Experts provide 80-99% of unique content.

## When to Use

- Industry trends and predictions
- Best practices compilations
- Tool recommendations
- Controversial/multi-perspective topics
- Influencer relationship building
- Link acquisition

## When NOT to Use

- Can't add editorial perspective beyond quotes
- Niche topics with few recognized experts
- Time-sensitive content (coordination takes time)
- Seeking BOFU conversions (roundups are TOFU/MOFU)
