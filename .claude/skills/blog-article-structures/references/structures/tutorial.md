# How-To / Tutorial Structure

**Core principle**: Break complex tasks into sequential, manageable steps with clear verification at each stage.

## Why It Works

Cognitive Load Theory: working memory has limited capacity. Tutorials reduce load by chunking tasks. "Worked examples effect" shows step-by-step solutions outperform problem-solving for learning.

## When to Use

- Procedural tasks with clear beginning/middle/end
- Software onboarding
- DIY projects, recipes
- Compliance training
- Any content with verifiable goal

## When NOT to Use

- Conceptual content without actionable steps
- Topics where outcomes vary by context
- Creative processes that shouldn't be linearized
