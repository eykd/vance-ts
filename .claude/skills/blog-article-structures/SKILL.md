# Blog & Article Structures

## Structure Selection Framework

Match structure to three factors:

1. **Content goal**: Inform → educate → persuade → convert
2. **Audience state**: Awareness level, expertise, intent
3. **Topic nature**: Complexity, actionability, emotional weight

### Quick Selection Guide

| Goal                 | Recommended Structures                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Inform quickly       | Inverted Pyramid, FAQ                   |
| Educate thoroughly   | What-Why-How, Tutorial, Tiered          |
| Persuade emotionally | PAS, BAB, Narrative Arc, Hero's Journey |
| Drive conversions    | AIDA, Comparison, Case Study            |
| Build authority      | Pillar Content, Expert Roundup          |
| Maximize engagement  | Listicle, Hook-Meat-Payoff              |
| Build connection     | Personal Essay, Narrative Arc           |

## Structure Categories

### Journalistic & Persuasion

- **Inverted Pyramid**: Most important info first, descending priority. Best for news, announcements, mobile-first. See [structures/inverted-pyramid.md](references/structures/inverted-pyramid.md)
- **PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)**: Pain → intensify → resolve. Leverages loss aversion. Best for SaaS, productivity tools, B2B. See [structures/pas.md](references/structures/pas.md)
- **BAB (Before-After-Bridge)**: Current state → ideal future → your solution as path. Best for coaching, courses, transformation products. See [structures/bab.md](references/structures/bab.md)
- **AIDA**: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action. Full conversion funnel. Best for landing pages, product launches, courses. See [structures/aida.md](references/structures/aida.md)

### Educational

- **Tutorial/How-to**: Sequential steps with verification. Reduces cognitive load. Best for software docs, DIY, recipes. See [structures/tutorial.md](references/structures/tutorial.md)
- **What-Why-How**: Concept → rationale → implementation. Best for introducing new methodologies, B2B strategy. See [structures/what-why-how.md](references/structures/what-why-how.md)
- **FAQ**: Question-driven, non-linear. Best for product pages, knowledge bases. See [structures/faq.md](references/structures/faq.md)
- **Tiered (Beginner-Intermediate-Advanced)**: Self-select by skill level. Best for technical training, comprehensive coverage. See [structures/tiered.md](references/structures/tiered.md)

### Content Marketing

- **Listicle**: Numbered items, highly scannable. Best for tips, tools, recommendations. See [structures/listicle.md](references/structures/listicle.md)
- **Pillar Content**: Comprehensive hub linking to cluster content. Best for SEO authority. See [structures/pillar.md](references/structures/pillar.md)
- **Comparison**: Side-by-side evaluation. Captures BOFU traffic (converts 25x better). See [structures/comparison.md](references/structures/comparison.md)
- **Case Study**: Results-focused customer narrative. See [structures/case-study.md](references/structures/case-study.md)
- **Roundup**: Expert quotes or curated resources. Best for backlinks, thought leadership. See [structures/roundup.md](references/structures/roundup.md)

### Narrative

- **Narrative Arc**: Exposition → rising action → climax → resolution. Triggers neural coupling. See [structures/narrative-arc.md](references/structures/narrative-arc.md)
- **Hero's Journey**: Customer as hero, brand as mentor (StoryBrand). See [structures/heros-journey.md](references/structures/heros-journey.md)
- **Hook-Meat-Payoff**: Attention capture → value delivery → actionable takeaway. Best for social, viral content. See [structures/hook-meat-payoff.md](references/structures/hook-meat-payoff.md)
- **Personal Essay**: First-person experience illuminating broader truth. See [structures/personal-essay.md](references/structures/personal-essay.md)

## Length Strategy

| Content Goal         | Words       | Rationale              |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Social sharing       | <1,000      | 60% more shares        |
| Quick how-tos        | 500-1,000   | Fast answers           |
| News/updates         | 300-800     | Timely, digestible     |
| SEO/organic          | 1,500-2,500 | Sweet spot for traffic |
| Thought leadership   | 2,000-3,000 | Demonstrates depth     |
| Comprehensive guides | 3,000-5,000 | Pillar content         |

**Key insight**: Positive correlation between length and traffic only up to ~2,000 words; beyond that, diminishing returns.

## Workflow

1. **Clarify goal**: What should reader do/feel/know after reading?
2. **Assess audience**: Awareness level? Expertise? Active problem?
3. **Select structure**: Use quick selection guide above
4. **Load template**: Read the relevant reference file for detailed outline
5. **Adapt**: Combine structures if needed (e.g., AIDA macro + PAS sections)
6. **Size appropriately**: Let structure guide length, not vice versa

## Combining Structures

Structures can layer:

- Inverted Pyramid + AIDA for informational posts with CTAs
- PAS within AIDA's Attention stage
- BAB's After section as AIDA's Desire component
- Narrative Arc providing macro structure while sections use PAS or BAB
